# neovim-playground

i wanted to redo my neovim configuration because it's pretty ass right now. i
also don't want to fuck up my whole life by wiping out my configuration. so
here is a nice clean isolated place to configure all my things.


## get going

```
./start.sh
```


## TODO

- [ ] get lsp to work
- [ ] add all my sets
- [ ] install all of my old plugins
- [ ] tmux navigator doesn't work ?
- [ ] nerd fonts?


## plugin notes

- don't need tpope commentary any more? that's just built in now?


## decision making

- [ ] is neo-tree better ?
